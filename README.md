My Milestone Project 1 is to used to display my skills learned in the following sections:
HTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals, and User Centric Frontend Developement.

---

The site is made for an imaginary company called Adriatic e-bike LTD.
The main goal of my webpage is to rent e-bikes online to explore the 10 largest Croatian islands. They are Korcula, Cres, Krk, Brac, Hvar, Pag, Dugi otok, Mljet, Vis and Rab. When renting online, the customer can choose 3 packages: Teambuilding Explore, Family & Friends Explore and Solo Explore.
Site is adressed to people who would like to
take on the role of a professional mountain bike rider but are not physically prepared for the difficult challenges of 
riding on top of a hill.
Also people with e-bikes can visit points of interest, restaurants, landmarks, and beaches around.
